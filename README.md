# Base React App - Backend

This is a basic backend for my basic react App.
It is made with Express.js, a simple Node.js module build for backend operations (like creating an API server).

## Why I need a backend?

You need a backend in order to store data or to execute some data manipulation.

## This example is completed?

Of course, no.
In this simple backend, I created a mock server, that retrieves some data from JSON and you can modify them in a temporary array.
Every time you will run this code, the data will be reset to default values

## Why you created this repository?

I created this repository for all my future projects, to keep in mind the basics to run a simple API server
